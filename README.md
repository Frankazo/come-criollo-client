## Planning Story

I develop this idea to build an app that helps connect people to small businesses in the area, for free. Allowing people to give honest reviews on businesses, letting people share and like, creating a community.
Planning began with two resources in mind, Restaurants, and Reviews, Restaurant will have all the documentation necessary to connect with the business, and it will contain the reviews, this reviews will have a title, description, and a rating, future iterations will have pictures, menu options, and the ability to like other's reviews.
